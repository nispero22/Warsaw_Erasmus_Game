# Warsaw_Erasmus_Game : how it works ?


This is a quizz game dedicated to non-Polish people.
There is one part with question of translation from English into Polish and a second part with geographic and cultural questions. 
You have three choices for each question and only one is exact. 
In total, you have to answer to 15 questions. At the end, you'll get a score reflecting your performance. 

To be able to be sucessful, you need to have spent a least a few months in Poland. That is why, Erasmus students in Warsaw are the main target.
