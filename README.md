# Warsaw_Erasmus_Game : how it works ?


This is a quiz game dedicated to non-Polish persons.
There is one part with question of translation from English into Polish and a second part with geographic and cultural related questions. I created databases with the help of wikipedia and a Polish-English dictionary. 
You have three choices for each question and only one is exact. 
In total, you have to answer to 15 questions. At the end, you get a score reflecting your performance. 

To be able to be successful, you need to have spent a least a few months in Poland. That is why, Erasmus students in Warsaw are my main target.
